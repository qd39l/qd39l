### Fast robot (2022)
[[web](https://qd39l.github.io/fast-robots/) | [demo video](https://youtu.be/MGXwT600lhQ)]

A fast robot car that can perform remote control, stunts, mapping, and localization. Software is programming in C++ running on a SparkFun Artemis Nano board.

### HPP Particle Simulation on FPGA (2022)
[[web](https://qd39l.github.io/HPP-cellular-automaton-FPGA/index.html) | [source code](https://github.com/qd39l/HPP-cellular-automaton-FPGA/tree/main/hpp_automata_src) | [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQd6q0IsZMc)]

- Designed from scratch a particle simulator (HPP cellular automaton) and implemented on a DE1-SoC FPGA
- Implementation of HPP cellular automaton in Verilog that supports simultaneous simulation of up to 1.2 million particles at 60 frames per second with 640 by 480 VGA output
- Developed C program for handling mouse inputs and control signals for FPGA
- Achieved >10X times speedup and >60X energy efficiency compared to software C (no video rendering) running on Apple M1 Max SoC

### A robot car from a microcontroller class (2021)
[[web](https://qd39l.github.io/intelligent-physical-system/) | [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJnsooBZ7q8)]

A very basic robot car that has light intensity sensors and an ultrasonic distance sensor.

### Matrix Sniper - An arcade shooting game (2020)
[[web](https://qd39l.github.io/Matrix-Sniper/) | [source code](https://github.com/qd39l/Matrix-Sniper/tree/main/source) | [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PombbTEN6Gc)]

A laser shooting arcade game using the FRDM-K64F board as the control unit.

# Favorite languages
My SW projects are mainly done in C/C++/Python. (BTW least favorite is Mathematica, but I'm not sure if it counts as a programming language...)

HW projects are done in Verilog for design and SystemVerilog for DV.
